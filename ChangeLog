	Added the ability to do case insensitive searches and
	to parse the response from Gmail.

2014-03-14  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Adding more debug info and correcting for \r's.
	Adding a debug section in the xml parsing.
	It seems owncloud/sabredav encode the \r's which libxml converts
	back to \r's so in the vcard regex/printing we should check to
	make sure they are not the second to last character, if they are
	we remove them.

	Adding the known query terms.
	In reading the man page, I forgot to add the known terms
	to the argument list.

	Adding example URLs to the README.

	Updating the ChangeLog and version number.

	Bug fix in the carddav (webdav) headders.
	When querying against owncloud (sabredav.org) we must specify the
	depth in the headers and not saying breif is true.

	Bugfix in xml namespace.
	Bug fix from Chip Black, there needs to be space between the xml
	namespace definitions for Apple's Calendar and Card server.

	Cleaning up all the supporting files in order to get ready for
	the 0.3 release.

2014-03-07  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Bug fix (malloc incorrect brackets).
	Bug fix in argument parsing routine. I had the +1 inside of the
	call to strlen().

	instead of 0.

2014-03-07  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Adding the C99 standard for autoconf and the removal of unused
	variables in the source.

	Bugfix. Renaming function.
	Missed a rename of the xml walk_nodes to walk_tree function.

	Merge branch 'master' of https://code.freeshell.org/mcds

	Split the parsing into xml and regex.
	Decided to bite the bullet and use libxml to do the initial parsing
	of the carddav data received. Then when a vcard is found, pass it
	off to a regex parser.

2014-03-05  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Upping the revision number.

	Updated the output to conform to mutt.

2014-03-05  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Adding the ability to print the full name.
	The mutt query command expects the results along the lines of:
		Searching database ... 20 entries ... 3 matching:
		me@cs.hmc.edu           Michael Elkins  mutt dude
		blong@fiction.net       Brandon Long    mutt and more
		roessler@guug.de        Thomas Roessler mutt pgp

	That is a one line message, then each matching response on a
	single line, each line containing a tab separated address then
	name then some other optional information. On error, or if there
	are no matching addresses, return a non-zero exit code and a
	one line error message.

2014-03-05  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Updated manpage.
	I had left in a reference to tbrown as the user in the carddav url.

	file.
